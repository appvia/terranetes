**Interested in commercial support or consultancy services? Please [get in touch](https://www.appvia.io/contact-us)!**

:::

Appvia offers two [subscription plans](#subscription-plans) for its products:

* Standard 
* Enterprise

Customers must have an active subscription to one of these plans to be able to access any support services provided by Appvia.

When a customer activates a product subscription, Appvia will onboard the customer's primary support contact to the [Appvia Support Portal](https://support.appvia.io/). Customers will then be able to provide access to the support portal to additional contacts. This will enable those customer contacts to obtain technical support and guidance on using Appvia products.

#### When a support ticket is raised

On raising a ticket, customers provides an initial priority level based on their initial understanding. The Appvia Support Team then determines if the ticket has a correct priority level, and may increase or decrease the assigned priority level where appropriate. In the event that the priority level is changed, this will be communicated to the customer on the ticket.
